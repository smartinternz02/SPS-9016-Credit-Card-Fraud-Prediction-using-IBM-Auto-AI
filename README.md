Steps using AutoAI

Step 1: Create an account with IBM Cloud

Step 2: Create a new Watson Studio project

Step 3: Adding Data from diffrent websites 

Step 4: Add Asset as Auto AI Experiment

Step 5: Create and define experiment

Step 6: Import the csv file to Assests in Watson Machine Learning service under the project

Step 7: Run experiment

Step 8: Analyze results and choose the best model having the highest Accuracy

Step 9: Deploy to Cloud

Step 10: Test the Model ( check "Test Result.png")

Step 11: Creating User Interface using Node Red for testing the model using node-Red App in IBM Cloud 

PS: Most of these steps are provided with screenshots in the Github Repository
